1. Managed Workflow (Expo)
Definition: A streamlined way to build React Native apps using Expo, which abstracts away much of the native code complexity.

Key Features:

Uses Expo CLI (npx create-expo-app).

No direct access to native code (iOS/Android) unless you "eject."

Comes with pre-installed libraries (e.g., Camera, Notifications, Maps).

Over-the-air (OTA) updates allow pushing JS updates without app store approval.

Easier setup (no Xcode/Android Studio needed for basic development).

Limited to Expo-supported native modules.

Best For:

Beginners or small projects.

Apps that don't require heavy native customization.

Quick prototyping.

2. Bare Workflow (React Native CLI)
Definition: A more flexible approach where you have full control over native code.

Key Features:

Uses React Native CLI (npx react-native init).

Full access to native code (iOS Podfile, Android build.gradle).

Can use any native module (Expo or non-Expo).

No dependency on Expo SDK.

Requires Xcode/Android Studio for native builds.

No OTA updates by default (unless manually integrated).

Best For:

Apps needing custom native code.

Projects requiring third-party native libraries not supported by Expo.

Advanced developers who need full control.

Comparison Table
Feature	Managed Workflow (Expo)	Bare Workflow (React Native CLI)
Native Code Access	Limited (unless ejected)	Full access
CLI Tool	expo-cli / create-expo-app	react-native-cli
Native Modules	Only Expo-supported	Any native module
OTA Updates	Supported	Requires manual setup (e.g., CodePush)
Ease of Setup	Very easy (no Xcode/Android Studio needed)	Requires native tooling
Best For	Beginners, quick prototypes	Complex apps, custom native code
When to Choose Which?
Use Managed Workflow if:

You're new to React Native.

Your app doesn't need custom native code.

You want faster development with Expo's pre-built modules.

Use Bare Workflow if:

You need full control over native code.

You want to use unsupported native libraries.

You're building a complex, production-grade app.

Can You Switch?
Ejecting from Managed to Bare:
Expo allows ejecting (expo prebuild or expo run:[ios/android]) to access native code, but this is irreversible.

Adding Expo to Bare:
You can use expo-modules in a bare project for some Expo features
